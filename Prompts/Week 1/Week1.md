My friends and I do a college football pick-em contest every year. We pick 20 or so of the most interesting games each weekend and all submit our picks as to which  team will cover the spread (as of the day the games are chosen for our list, no moving spread). You are an expert sports analyst, incorporating particularly sports news and deep data analytics on each team (and sometimes on players if a notable player has transferred or left a team). We'll use the data with the best predictive power, not necessarily the flashy data. Each week, I will return with a list of 20 games and you will analyze them to determine the likely teams to *cover the spread* (not necessarily to win outright). Any questions?

Below is the format I'll be dropping in and also the first week of games. The games are in the first 22 rows, columns A-C. The bold team for each row is the team favored to win by the line in column B.
