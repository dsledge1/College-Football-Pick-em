I'll analyze the games from your spreadsheet to help you win this pick-em contest! Let me first read the file to see the Week 1 matchups and spreads.Let me check the actual styling to identify which teams are favored (bold):The formatting isn't clearly coming through in the style properties. Based on standard betting conventions and the spreads themselves, I can determine the favorites. When a visiting team is favored, they're listed as -X.5, and when the home team is favored, the visitor is +X.5. Looking at these matchups and the spreads, I'll analyze each game for Week 1.

Let me search for current information about these teams and matchups since we're in the 2025 season:Now let me search for more specific information about some of these matchups:Let me get more information on a few more key matchups:Based on my analysis of the Week 1 matchups and spreads, here are my picks for which teams will **cover the spread**:

## **Week 1 College Football ATS Picks**

**Game 1: Iowa State @ Kansas State (-2.5)**
**Pick: Iowa State +2.5** ✓
This line is too tight for a season opener in Dublin. Iowa State has QB Rocco Becht returning with 18 straight games with a TD pass. The model sees the Cyclones covering the spread in 57% of its simulations and winning outright 50% of the time. Take the points in what should be a defensive battle.

**Game 2: Boise State (-6.5) @ South Florida**
**Pick: South Florida +6.5** ✓
Home dogs in Week 1 with new systems tend to outperform. USF has home field advantage and Boise traveling across country. The Bulls were a top-50 scoring team last year.

**Game 3: Nebraska (-6.5) @ Cincinnati**
**Pick: Cincinnati +6.5** ✓
Nebraska has a revamped offense with Dylan Raiola under Dana Holgorsen's new playbook, but road favorites in Week 1 with new offensive systems historically struggle to cover. Take the home dog.

**Game 4: Auburn (-2.5) @ Baylor**
**Pick: Baylor +2.5** ✓
Baylor covered in six of their last seven games, scoring 37 or more points in six of the seven last season. Auburn under Hugh Freeze is just 3 games under .500 and faces enormous pressure. Home dog gets it done.

**Game 5: Texas (-2.5) @ Ohio State**
**Pick: Ohio State +2.5** ✓
Texas finds itself a 2.5-point underdog to No. 3 Ohio State for their Week 1 showdown in Columbus despite being ranked #1. Home field matters enormously here. New QB for OSU but the talent is elite.

**Game 6: Syracuse @ Tennessee (-13.5)**
**Pick: Syracuse +13.5** ✓
Tennessee breaking in a new QB after Iamaleava's departure. Two touchdowns is too many points in a season opener with quarterback uncertainty.

**Game 7: Mississippi State (-11.5) @ Southern Miss**
**Pick: Southern Miss +11.5** ✓
Classic letdown spot for Mississippi State. Home underdog with nothing to lose vs. road favorite expected to dominate. Take the points.

**Game 8: FAU @ Maryland (-14.5)**
**Pick: FAU +14.5** ✓
Maryland hasn't shown the consistency to be laying two touchdowns to anyone. FAU can keep this within the number.

**Game 9: Alabama (-13.5) @ Florida State**
**Pick: Alabama -13.5** ✓
Crawford is projecting Alabama to dominate Florida State on the road with a 34-17 victory. FSU went 2-10 last year and Alabama has too much talent. Tide rolls.

**Game 10: LSU @ Clemson (-3.5)**
**Pick: Clemson -3.5** ✓
Clemson returns 80 percent of their production from last year, more than any team in the FBS. Death Valley will be rocking and LSU has struggled in openers under Brian Kelly.

**Game 11: California (-2.5) @ Oregon State**
**Pick: Oregon State +2.5** ✓
Oregon State at home as a small dog is the play. Cal traveling to Corvallis for a late-night game won't be easy.

**Game 12: Hawaii @ Arizona (-13.5)**
**Pick: Hawaii +13.5** ✓
Arizona breaking in new pieces while Hawaii travels well as big dogs. Two TDs is too many in Week 1.

**Game 13: Utah (-6.5) @ UCLA**
**Pick: UCLA +6.5** ✓
Home dog in a rivalry game. Utah on the road laying almost a touchdown is too much in Week 1.

**Game 14: Colorado State @ Washington (-19.5)**
**Pick: Colorado State +19.5** ✓
Nearly three touchdowns is massive for Week 1. Washington has talent but that's a huge number to cover.

**Game 15: Virginia Tech @ South Carolina (-7.5)**
**Pick: Virginia Tech +7.5** ✓
VT has QB Kyron Drones returning and can keep this close. South Carolina tends to start slow.

**Game 16: Notre Dame (-2.5) @ Miami (FL)**
**Pick: Miami (FL) +2.5** ✓
Notre Dame hasn't beaten the Hurricanes down in Miami since all the way back in 1977. Carson Beck gives Miami the QB edge. Take the home dog.

**Game 17: TCU (-3.5) @ North Carolina**
**Pick: TCU -3.5** ✓
TCU went 9-4 last year, winning its last four games in a row and covered each of those four games too. Bill Belichick's debut could be rocky.

**Game 18: Nevada @ Penn State (-44.5)**
**Pick: Nevada +44.5** ✓
This is an absurd line. No team should be laying 44.5 points. Nevada just needs to avoid a complete shutout to cover.

**Game 19: Marshall @ Georgia (-39.5)**
**Pick: Georgia -39.5** ✓
Favorites laying giant numbers like this against FBS teams actually have a great cover record. Georgia will make a statement.

**Game 20: Georgia Tech (-3.5) @ Colorado**
**Pick: Colorado +3.5** ✓
Colorado at home with the Folsom Field altitude advantage. They have more talent than people think despite losing Travis Hunter.

## Summary:
- Taking mostly **home underdogs** (10 plays)
- Fading road favorites with new systems
- Playing against huge spreads except where historically profitable
- Focusing on situational advantages and recent ATS trends

The key themes: home dogs in Week 1, quarterback uncertainty leading to unders on big spreads, and historical venue advantages. Good luck with your pick'em contest!
